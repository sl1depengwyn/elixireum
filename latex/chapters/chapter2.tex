\chaptermark{Second Chapter Heading}

This chapter serves as an introduction to the Ethereum ecosystem and offers an overview of the relevant literature.

Section \ref{sec:evm} introduces the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and explores its gas consumption mechanism. Following that, Section \ref{sec:langs} examines of the existing languages compatible with the EVM. Section \ref{sec:ex} presents an overview of the Elixir programming language. To conclude, Section \ref{sec:conc} concludes this chapter with key decisions and findings from the literature.

\section{Ethereum Virtual Machine}
\label{sec:evm}
According to \cite{EthereumWhitepaper}, Ethereum is a decentralized system, and at its core, the EVM is an essential component of the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM serves as the computational heart of the Ethereum network, enabling the execution of smart contracts and providing the foundation for a wide array of decentralized applications.

EVM has a significant security mechanism -- gas limit. Each operation and computation on the EVM consumes a certain amount of gas -- a measure of computational work. The gas limit is a cap set by the user or the entity initiating a contract execution, and it represents the maximum amount of gas they are willing to spend for that operation.

The gas limit, the stack-based architecture of the EVM, and the broad set of available operations allow it to  execute these smart contracts efficiently and securely for miners. Also, Buterin \cite{EthereumWhitepaper} defines EVM as a Turing-complete machine. This level of computational flexibility empowers developers to create sophisticated programs.

\section{Existing EVM languages}
\label{sec:langs}
Official Ethereum documentation \cite{OfficialEthereumLanguages} enumerates only four languages that compile to EVM: Solidity, Vyper, Yul, and Fe. Also, other attempts to create a language for EVM are known\footnote{\href{https://github.com/s-tikhomirov/smart-contract-languages}{A curated collection of resources on smart contract programming languages}}, but only officially documented languages will be considered in this paper.

Among the available languages for EVM, Solidity stands out as the most widely adopted and utilized one \cite{SolidityWidelyUsed, SolidityDevsChallenges}. This dominance is further emphasized by data presented in \footnote{\href{https://blockchain.oodles.io/blog/solidity-vyper-smart-contracts-programming/}{Analyzing Solidity and Vyper for Smart Contracts Programming}}, which reveals that there are approximately 800 times more Solidity files on Github than Vyper files. Consequently, most existing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are written in Solidity. On the one hand, the concentration of development and resources around a single language like Solidity can be viewed positively. It fosters a strong sense of community cohesion and ensures that the majority of developers are focused on refining and improving a single language, potentially enhancing its robustness and feature set. However, this dominance also brings significant challenges. The high prevalence of Solidity in the EVM ecosystem means that if a vulnerability or security flaw arises in the Solidity language, it affects a substantial portion of the smart contracts on the network. This centralized risk can be a double-edged sword, as a single point of failure in Solidity could have far-reaching consequences for the entire Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, the Ethereum community is not without its criticisms of Solidity. Community members have voiced their concerns and challenges related to the language \cite{SolidityDevsChallenges}. These concerns range from the complexity of the language to its lack of certain features, which may hinder the development of robust and secure smart contracts. So, decentralization and availability of choice are essential, especially for a decentralized ecosystem like blockchain.

\subsection{Solidity}

Solidity is a high-level, object-oriented programming, statically typed language explicitly designed for the EVM. Its syntax is similar to C++, Python, and Javascript \cite{SolidityInspirasion}. It supports multiple inheritance, complex user-defined types, libraries, and some other features \cite{SolidityFeatures}.

\subsection{Vyper}

Vyper contrasts significantly with Solidity. It is based on Python and extends it to suit smart contract development. Vyper aims for security and simplicity in terms of compiler implementation itself and code readability to be auditable more easily. For instance, it lacks a list of features considered harmful for code readability, making the language more error-prone \cite{VyperDescription}.

\section{The Elixir language}
\label{sec:ex}

Elixir \cite{ElixirOfficialWebSite} is a modern programming language that operates on the Erlang Virtual Machine. With its support for immutable variables, Elixir dramatically enhances the clarity and simplicity of smart contract code. This immutability ensures that once data are defined, they cannot be altered, promoting predictability and security in the context of smart contract development.

A standout feature of Elixir is its metaprogramming capabilities. This functionality empowers developers to create domain-specific languages that are tailor-made for the intricacies of smart contract logic. This capability is invaluable as it allows developers to express contract logic in both highly readable and closely aligned with the specific problem domain way. By employing metaprogramming, smart contract development will become more straightforward and accessible to a broader spectrum of developers.

As attested by O'Grady \cite{RedMonk}, Elixir stands strong among the top 50 programming languages. Remarkably, it surpasses even the popularity of Solidity, making it an attractive choice for Ethereum developers and thereby contributing to the expansion of the Ethereum community.

In summation, our decision to adopt Elixir as the language for our compiler and as the foundational framework for the Elixireum language is bolstered by its immutability, metaprogramming capabilities, and prominence in the software development landscape. This choice ensures the simplicity and security of smart contract development and the growth and diversification of the Ethereum ecosystem.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In conclusion, this chapter has emphasized two significant matters. Firstly, the overwhelming dominance of Solidity has brought substantial challenges to the Ethereum ecosystem. Secondly, the absence of functional languages for smart contract development has limited the utilization of functional paradigm advantages. Consequently, we have decided to develop Elixireum, a functional programming language built on Elixir, explicitly tailored for smart contract development.
