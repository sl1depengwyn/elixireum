\section{Ethereum Virtual Machine}
Ethereum Virtual Machine is an essential part of the Ethereum Blockchain. EVM is a stack based. Smart contracts are programs which run on the EVM. It used to control cryptocurrency and other doings

\section{Existing EVM languages}
According to the official Ethereum documentation \cite{OfficialEthereumLanguages} only four languages for EVM exist: Solidity, Vyper, Yul and Fe. However, other attempts to create language for EVM are known \cite{CommunityEthereumLanguages}

Solidity, Vyper, yul and fe are among  A number of officially supported languages exist

\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}

This description implies several essential properties of the task at hand:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Watermark must contain all necessary information, but still, be placeable and recognizable even on smaller images. The produced watermark must be compact but have the possibility to store enough information. 
    \item To prevent easy tampering, the watermark must be invisible to the naked eye (and, preferably, to basic image parsing tools). If malefactor does not know about the existence of watermark, they might not even try to remove it and disable it. 
\end{enumerate}
