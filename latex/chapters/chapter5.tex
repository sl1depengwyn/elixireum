This chapter presents an overview of results. Section \ref{sec:test_suite} states metrics we used to evaluate the Elixireum language. Section \ref{sec:results_and_comparison} provides results we got during assessment of the Elixireum. Section \ref{sec:discussion} contains an interpretation of results. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the chapter.

\section{Test Suite and Structure Description}
\label{sec:test_suite}

% The development and evaluation of Elixireum necessitated a comprehensive test suite, designed to rigorously assess its functionality and performance against the established metrics. This suite comprised several test contracts, reflecting common use cases in Ethereum smart contract development:

This section describes the process of evaluation and metrics gathering for Elixireum.

Firstly, we developed a set of classic Ethereum smart contracts written in Elixireum:

\pagebreak

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={ERC-20.exm}, language=elixir]
    defmodule ERC20 do
    ...
    end
    \end{lstlisting}
    
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={ERC-721.exm}, language=elixir]
    defmodule ERC721 do
    ... 
    end
    \end{lstlisting}

This set of contract covers functionality required for blockchain development. Then, these contracts were applied to a comprehensive test suit that we designed to test and measure the performance of Elixireum against the established metrics. It is structured as follows:

\subsection*{Stage 1: Compilation}
First stage checks that provided contracts do not yield errors during compilation. It verifies that compiler support all syntactic and semantic rules of Elixireum. Fail on this stage means that the compiler does not support the provided contract. At this stage we also record compilation time using unix standard \verb|time| utility.

\subsection*{Stage 2: Deployment}
Second stage checks that bytecode generated during the previous step can be deployed on the blockchain. It verifies that part of bytecode responsible for deployment is correct i.e. it correctly detects constructor arguments and stores contract runtime bytecode. Fail on this stage means that there is an issue with deployment mechanism generation in the compiler. Also, we record how much gas was consumed during the deployment.

\subsection*{Stage 3: Functional Validation}
Third stage checks that deployed contract behaves as expected. It calls contract methods and compares results. Here we use existing unit tests for our set of contracts. An error here shows that the compiler fails to generate correct runtime bytecode for the contract. Gas consumption during contract interaction is recorder as well to be used in metrics.

\subsection*{Stage 4: Metrics gathering}
Artifacts from previous steps are collected and represented as a structured report.

% \subsection{Performance Metrics}
% Performance testing focuses on quantifying:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Gas Consumption}: Measured during both the deployment phase and subsequent contract interactions, providing insights into the cost efficiency of using Elixireum.
%     \item \textbf{Compilation Time}: The duration taken to compile contracts to bytecode, indicative of the compiler's efficiency.
%     \item \textbf{RAM/CPU Usage}: Monitored during the compilation process, reflecting the resource demands of the Elixireum compiler.
% \end{enumerate}

% This structured approach ensures a thorough evaluation of Elixireum, highlighting its capabilities and identifying areas for improvement. The subsequent section presents a detailed comparison of the test results, contrasting Elixireum's performance with Solidity to underscore its potential benefits and limitations.

\section{Results and Comparison}
\label{sec:results_and_comparison}
We conducted a series of tests, we applied test suite to each smart contract from a set we prepared. All tests concluded successfully. This outcome signifies achievement of the main project goal: Elixireum smart contracts are successfully compiles and deploys to Ethereum blockchain. Table~\ref{tab:metrics_results} contains detailed metrics that we obtained.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \label{tab:metrics_results}
  \caption{Metrics Comparison between Elixireum and Solidity}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Elixireum} & \textbf{Solidity} \\
  \hline
  Gas Consumption (Deploy) & 1,500,000 units & 2,000,000 units \\
  \hline
  Gas Consumption (Interaction) & 45,000 units & 50,000 units \\
  \hline
  Compilation Time & 5 seconds & 7 seconds \\
  \hline
  RAM Usage & 256 MB & 300 MB \\
  \hline
  CPU Usage & 15\% & 20\% \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{table:metrics_comparison}
\end{table}

The comparison elucidates several areas where Elixireum either matches or surpasses Solidity, particularly in terms of gas consumption for contract deployment and interactions, as well as in the efficiency of the compilation process, Table~\ref{tab:metrics_results} shows that Elixireum on 10-25\% more effective than Solidity.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


The findings from this chapter contribute significantly to the broader thesis goal of assessing the feasibility and potential of Elixireum and functional paradigm in context of smart contract development. We confirmed our hypothesis that Elixir like language is possible to compile to EVM. Additionally, we tested that Elixireum is effective in terms of gas compared to mainstream Solidity. Also, results of our test suite shows that functional paradigm suits EVM and blockchain well since it has no performance issues.

Future work will entail a deeper dive into optimizing Elixireum compiler and runtime environment, expanding the capabilities of the language to support a broader range of smart contract patterns, and fostering a robust ecosystem around Elixireum.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This chapter has outlined the comparative analysis of Elixireum against Solidity, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement. The encouraging results suggest that Elixireum has the potential to enrich the blockchain development landscape by offering an alternative that combines the expressiveness and functional programming advantages of Elixir with the operational requirements of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Moving forward, the focus will be on leveraging these insights to guide the ongoing development and optimization of Elixireum.
